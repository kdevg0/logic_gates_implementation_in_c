This source code , when compiled , gives a program that simulates/implements some circuits I developed.Those circuits are--
1)One that compares two numbers.
2)One that can add a binary number to another.
3)The last one,which can subtract a small number from a large number.
Most probably I won't modify this code in future.Because tomorrow,I'll be submitting my project to college and I wont need to modify it further.Besides,the exam is near.However,I may change my mind again later.Also,I may rename it later, to include other projects too.Thanks.
